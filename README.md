# Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
This repository builds upon the original work by [CorentinJâ€™s Real-Time-Voice-Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning). Modifications and experiments were made to test alternative embedding architectures such as Transformers, CNNs, and LSTMs. All original credit for the voice cloning model and training pipeline goes to the original authors.
